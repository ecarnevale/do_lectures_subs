1
00:00:00,000,00 --> 00:00:11,500
 

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm so excited to be here 

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,300
I'm doing a little bit of nervousness right now 

4
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,900
but I'm standing here today 23 years old  

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,600
 

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,700
and I flew in the day before yesterday from Nepal 

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,400
 

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
How does a 23yo american girl  

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,900
from New Jersey college bound 4 years ago 

10
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,200
end up in a remote himalayan village raising over 200 

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,400
children who've been orphan as results of disease and civil war?  

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,600
I'm here to tell you that story today  

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,100
and I hope you enjoy it 

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,700
The name of my project is Kopila Valley Children's Home 

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,700
and just a couple of months actually we launched a school called Kopila Valley Primary School  

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,100
My story began  

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,300
exactly 5 years ago  

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,900
when I woke up one morning at 18 years old  

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,800
and I had a scary realization 

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,100
I went to a great a public school in the US 

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,000
I received what I think is one of the best educations our system has to offer, 

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
but as much as I knew about  

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,600
the outside world and all the facts that I've been forced to memorize 

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,900
 and retain on history and math, 

25
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:38,700
I knew very little about myself and what I wanted in my life and the inside sort of things  

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,500
and I was very lucky I woke up with that feeling at 18. 

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
So I deferred college, I put off my university 

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,100
for what I thought was going to be a year 

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,900
and I packed up a backpack  

30
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,000
with very few belongings and I decided to take a trip all around the world  

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,900
I never really traveled, never left my country,  

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,900
I've been on camping trips so I knew how to rough it 

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,300
and packed everything I owned  

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,700
as my friends where going off to their dorms  

35
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,900
and set off to travel and hike and discover  

36
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,800
I started off in the South Pacific Islands  

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,700
and did volunteer work, conservation work 

38
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,400
all of the sudden my whole world  

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,500
opened up, there was so much to learn, so much to discover 

40
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,700
outside of the 4 walls of a classroom  

41
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,300
and I got my passion back, my passion to live, 

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,900
to learn and to be human on this earth again 

43
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,300
 

44
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,900
After that first couple of months  

45
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,600
I realized I was hungry for more and I decided  

46
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,500
to sign up for an internship in north eastern India  

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,900
in a project for children 

48
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,400
and I didn't know anything 

49
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,500
it's good being young. 

50
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,700
I just packed up my backpack again 

51
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,400
got in an airplane and  

52
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,300
set out for a foothill region in the north eastern India  

53
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,600
and I was working with children  

54
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,700
and it turned out that  

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,100
where I happened to be volunteering and working 

56
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,200
I was working with nepalese refugees, 

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,700
a nepali refugee community 

58
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,500
and as good my education was I didn't know 

59
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,400
that Nepal was even a country 

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,800
when I was 18 years old 

61
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
I didn't know what was going on 

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
I didn't know there've been a civil war 

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,500
that forced children and families to flee their homes  

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,100
and come to India, in this country that was still foreign to them 

65
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,900
 

66
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,600
Picture your typical poverty  

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,900
typical refugee community  

68
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,300
living under plastic,  

69
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
no water 

70
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,900
menial jobs that even the untouchable indians won't do 

71
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,200
and I started asking questions  

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,200
if their living in these conditions that are so bad, 

73
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,000
what they are running away from? 

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,300
and it just so happened in 2006 that there was an armistice 

75
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,700
and the border to Nepal opened up for the first time 

76
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,100
and I became really curious and I wanted to take a trip, 

77
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,300
so I packed my backpack again 

78
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,100
and I decided with my good friend Sunita  

79
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,800
Nepalese refugee, young girl, 16 years old 

80
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,700
who'd left her village at about 8 

81
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,600
and never returned 

82
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,100
at the start of the Maoists insurgency 

83
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,200
the two of us has become friends and 

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,300
we're reading the happenings 

85
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,000
and sort of trying to figure out what was going on in the country 

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And we decided to take a trip 

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,300
and I had no idea what I was in for 

88
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,400
I got in the bus 

89
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,600
I was on that bus for 2 days 

90
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,500
and then the driver sort of looked back at us 

91
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,300
to these 2 young girls and he said 

92
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,100
alright it's the end of the road it's time to get out 

93
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,200
and sure enough we got out and ahead of us 

94
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,000
was this himalayan stretch 

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,200
of the most beautiful landscape I'd ever seen 

96
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
and no road 

97
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,300
and we got out and we had to trek for 2.5 days, 

98
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,100
until we found Sunita's village 

99
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600


100
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,000
so I'm in a post-civil war 

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
very ravaged, the war just ended 

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,400
but just stunned by the beauty 

103
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,900
and the sense of community and we trekked 

104
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,800
I was the most sore I'd ever been, even as an athlete 

105
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,500
but we made it 

106
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,200
and the sad thing we discovered was that Sunita's home 

107
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,200
and her family 

108
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,600
had sort of disappeared 

109
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,600
her village hut had been converted into the maoist military basecamp center 

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
and her family wasn't there 

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,000


112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,400
again it was a meaningful trip 

113
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,100
we got information on her family 

114
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,400
and I felt this sense of belonging and this sense of home 

115
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,800
that I hadn't felt in a very long time 

116
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,500
and I knew there was something for me 

117
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,800
so, my travels continued 

118
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,800
and I ultimately ended up doing some city traveling 

119
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
trek back down 

120
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,400
and I was walking down the road one day 

121
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,300
when I locked eyes with this little girl 

122
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,600
her name's Lakoda 

123
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,000
and I soon came to know that 

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,100
this was her job, she is a child porter 

125
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,400
and her job every day 

126
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
was to take loads 

127
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,700
this is about 60kg 

128
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,000
from the bus park all the way into the villages 

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,300
and she go back and forth, back and forth, all day 

130
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,900
and as we know child labour 

131
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,100
this is the reality of it 

132
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,600
she make a $, $2 in the day 

133
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
to feed her family 

134
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,200
this is the life of a nepalese orphan 

135
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,100
this is the life of an orphan child in our world today 

136
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,600


137
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,900
I looked at her and I saw every single piece of myself 

138
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,500
and I was devastated 

139
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,300
I thought, what've we done as a human family 

140
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,500
that our children are living this way? 

141
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,800
I thought of myself, I saw every single piece of myself in this child 

142
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,000
and I've thought, "oh God I grew up with a trampoline in my backyard 

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,700
and I was in a soccer field, and I was going to my first dance when I was her age" 

144
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,500
and my whole world just collapsed in a second 

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,000
and I soon kept reading 

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,200
and I found out there're 80 million children just like her in the world 

147
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,300
and I was devastated, I was ashamed to be part of this human family 

148
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,000
if this the way our children are living 

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,200
I promise it get happier this story 

150
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,300


151
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,400
so I continued to meet them, I was fascinated with these young girls 

152
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,700
and there're stories of children on this side of this one particular riverbed 

153
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,800
that I had to cross everyday to get to my room 

154
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,300
where we were renting 

155
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,700
and these girls would pick up dry rocks from the side of the riverbed 

156
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
and break them into smaller pieces 

157
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,000
and they'd sell them 

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
and they were happy 

159
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,400
believe it or not, there were smiles on their faces 

160
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,100
and they made a life out of this for themselves 

161
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,100
and then I met one particular girl, 

162
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,900
her name was hima 

163
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,000
this is hima here 

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
she was 7yo 

165
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,800
and she was one of those children on the side of the dry riverbed 

166
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,600
but every day when I walked to meet her 

167
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,700
she just smiled these big bright eyes 

168
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,900
and she said "Namaste, Didi" 

169
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,300
and someday she'd picking up garbage 

170
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,400
but everyday was the same smile on the same look and it captured me 

171
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,100
and I thought for the first time 

172
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,200
"Ok, Maggie, forget the one million kids, forget the 80 millions" 

173
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,100
I can't begin to wrap my fingers and my head around these stats 

174
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,900
what if you just start with Hima 

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,500
is there something that you can do to change the life of just one child 

176
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,100
and I went around to the community, in the village 

177
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,300
and I talked to principals, and village leaders, and the elders 

178
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,700
and sure enough I found the reason why all these children where out of school 

179
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,000
it was because they needed the income to support their families 

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,900
and they couldn't afford the tuition fees, the uniform and the books 

181
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,700
a pretty big chunk of money 

182
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,300
which is about $8 to $10 

183
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,400
and I thought at 18 and with the entrepreneurial mind that I have 

184
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,600
ok I can do that 

185
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,700
what if I just support the education of this one child 

186
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,300
how'd her life change? 

187
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,500
This is Hima a couple of weeks later 

188
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,100
I put her into school 

189
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,700
and followed and tracked her progress 

190
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,600
and her life sure enough did change 

191
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,000
if you know what happens when we educate young girls and women 

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
the stats are unbelievable 

193
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,000
it's not about it's just the right thing to do to put a child into primary school 

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,600
the world will change when our children and our women are educated 

195
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,400
they have less children 

196
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,500
they raise better families, they raise more educated children 

197
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,700
their diseases, everything decreases, poverty levels 

198
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,800
communities and villages change 

199
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,400
and the thing about this work that I do is that it's very addicting so I thought 

200
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,000
ok, one kid. If I can do one, why not 10, why not 5? 

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,100
what if my dream was walk across this dry riverbed one day and not see a single child breaking stone 

202
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:56,300
that's what I want, I wanted create a world that I want to see every day 

203
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,900
so these were the next 5 girls 

204
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,000
that I enrolled into school. 

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
but the sad thing was I didn't think was enough 

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
there were kids that didn't have homes and families 

207
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,600
they're orphans 

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,900
one day I'd this idea 

209
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,100
I found a piece of land 

210
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,900
and it just happened to be $5000 

211
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:26,300
I wanted to build a home for orphan kids, a home and a school and a base 

212
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,200
the kids couldn't go to school 'cause they didn't have a home 

213
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,000


214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,300
they could call this place their home 

215
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,800
I called my parents one day 

216
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,400
and I said 

217
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,500
can you send over my $5000 of lifesavings? 

218
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,600
I saved that from the time I was about 6 years old, every penny 

219
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,300
I babysat starting from the time I was 12 to when I was 18 

220
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,600
and we had a very long conversation that day, 

221
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I think it was the middle of the night over there in the US 

222
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,700
and sure enough because my parents are amazing people 

223
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:05,100
they wired over that $5000 and I bought my first piece of property in Nepal 

224
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,400
and I found this beautiful community of people and women and villagers and elders who wanted to help me 

225
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,900
and wanted to support me and take part in this 

226
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,800
we'd no money left after that, just a vision in this dream 

227
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
and a couple of shovels 

228
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,600
so all we did was take those shovels and dig a hole in the ground 

229
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,500
that was all we could do 

230
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,800
and I just had to get my hands dirty 

231
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,800
and to be a part of it 

232
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,100
I'd see everything that I wanted to create in my mind 

233
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,300
but we didn't have the resources 

234
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,200
we just had the sense of hope in that this was the right thing to do 

235
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,900
this is one of the best days of my life 

236
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,100
the whole village came out 

237
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,600
and we dug the foundation to the home 

238
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,700
every good home needs a solid foundation 

239
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:53,000
I didn't have anything left except for a ticket home 

240
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,600
so I went home and I started to babysit 

241
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,300
I thought that I could babysit and nanny my way into building this home for children 

242
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:06,900
and I got about 2 or 3 weeks in and I realized I have just enough money to build this septic tank 

243
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,100
so I started to share my story with children and my community 

244
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,200
and sure enough with garage sales and every fundraiser, big sales 

245
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,700
you know, little, dollar at a time, we saved enough money to build this 

246
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:26,100
and then the story broke in the newspaper "local girl's trying to build a home for children" 

247
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,100
sure enough $20-$40 donations started coming in 

248
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,100
and the home started going up 

249
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,700
this is Cheran 

250
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,700
my main mason, my hero 

251
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,400
he build and helped with the design of the home 

252
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,800
we had over 200 local people come out to take part in the construction 

253
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,200
this is one of my favourites, Dev 

254
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,700
and in just 6 months 

255
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,000
we built this 

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,700
it's a 2 storey home 

257
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,700
that's now the home of 30 orphan children in Nepal 

258
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,000
I got my first big break 

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,200
to build the second storey, when I got a call from Cosmo Girl Magazine 

260
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,800
they announced I was the winner of $20,000 from Maybelline, believe it or not. 

261
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,900
I don't wear a lot of makeup 

262
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,100
so that's pretty ironic 

263
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,200
this girl on the phone calls up, she's in her 20s, she's very cosmopolitan New York city 

264
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,100
"Guess what, I've the best news for you" and I'm like "What?!" 

265
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,000
"You just won $20,000 from Maybelline 

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,500
and I'm shocked, like my heart's speeding $20,000 is a ton of money over there 

267
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,900
she goes: "It gets even better" 

268
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,900
and I'm like: "What? What could possible better than $20,000 for my children 

269
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,600
and she goes: 

270
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,600
"We're gonna whisk you in NYC for a Maybelline makeover 

271
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,900
and I thought "OK" 

272
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,300
I had lice in my hair at that time 

273
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,000
I still remember the hairdresser looking at me like: 

274
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,700
"Oh my gosh, how did this girl get here" 

275
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:06,500
but these are my children and this is where that $20,000 went 

276
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,500
and the makeover was worth it. I didn't let them dye my hair chocolate brown 

277
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,200
That was just somethings I wouldn't given to. 

278
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,400
this is my family, I think this is when we're about 15 

279
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,200
we've since grown to 30 

280
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:27,100
Kopila is the home of children like Karma, she was sold at the age of 6 or 7 as a domestic servant 

281
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,500
and her job was to take care of her of the younger children in this family 

282
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,000
and every day she put their uniforms on and sent them off to school 

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,600
and I've a clip of her expressing that sadness of sending the children off a path to school and not being able to go 

284
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
she came down to live with us barefoot, she walked for 4 days to get from her village 

285
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,500
and she did about 4 years worth of schooling in just one year, taught herself to read and write 

286
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,100
we found her up in her bedroom writing the ABCs 

287
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,900
this is my Nevine 

288
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,600
it's amazing how these children take care of each other 

289
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,500
they bring each other in 

290
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,700
they just love one another so much 

291
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,400
we can't even get them to sleep into separate beds 

292
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,800
these are 3 of my girls 

293
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,800
I could spend days telling you their stories 

294
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,000


295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,600
all of them would be the first literate generation of their families 

296
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,200
the first girls and boys to get the chance to go to school 

297
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,600
learn how to write their own name 

298
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,100
we push sustainability: the children grown their own food their own vegetables 

299
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,500
they're part of the cooking process 

300
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,000
we raise goats and turkeys and chicken and cows 

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,200
it's really an important part of what we do 

302
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,100
especially in a country like Nepal where 90% of the population relies on subsistence farming 

303
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,900
so we're trying to raise them with that awareness 

304
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900


305
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:56,300
I wish you could all come it's just this beautiful place, this beautiful slice of hope 

306
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,500
Shortly after just last year, actually 

307
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,000
I won a $100,000 from an organization called "DoSomething.org" 

308
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,400
which was just a dream come true 

309
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,200
things sort of just began to fall into place going from having no money 

310
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,900
to all of a sudden having a $100,000 check in my hand 

311
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,600
to do whatever I wanted 

312
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,400
it was amazing 

313
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,100
this is the night we found out we won the money 

314
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,400
this is me with my parents 

315
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,500
and without them, without their yes that they gave me to live my dream and follow my heart 

316
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,000
this wouldn't be possible 

317
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,700
so I wanted to put them in here 

318
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,200
and with that $100,000, true to our American culture 

319
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,900
I got my picture on the back of Doritos, America's favourite snack food 

320
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,600
so if you're ever in the States pick them up it's the 'Cool Ranch' flavour 

321
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,700


322
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:50,200
All of a sudden I had $100,000 in a year to build this school for 200 kids, over 200 children 

323
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,400
at the same time this little boy was abandoned at the local bus station 

324
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,700
and I found myself with a 1.5 year old 

325
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,000
and he didn't have a name so 

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,600
he had a scar on his forehead 

327
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,300
and the kids named him Harry Potter 

328
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,000
this is me with Harry 

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,300
but we had to find a piece of land, right away 

330
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,900
and I wanted to start, I wanted to get my hands dirty 

331
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,900
the first I actually did with the money was take the kids on elephant rides 

332
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,200


333
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:24,000
I decided for the architecture piece to go with bamboo 

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
which if you can do some reading on bamboo constructions 

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,500
it's sustainable, locally harvested, very strong, believe it or not, structurally 

336
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,600
this is my son, Santo holding a piece 

337
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,900
and sure enough people, the right people just started sort of show up 

338
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,400
to help 

339
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,900
I had an architect come over from Australia 

340
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,800
Orr Niv, he left his high paid job, step out the office 

341
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,600
heard of our story, and said "Hey, I'd come over and design this thing for you" 

342
00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:00,400
the cool thing about bamboo when you're on a low budget like I was 

343
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,000
you can take it apart and put it back together 

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,800
has a lifespan of about 20 years 

345
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,400
it's like legos it's actually very fun to build with 

346
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,800
but the local people didn't know how to use it and harvest it actually 

347
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,700
so Orr did the job of really training the local team to build this by themselves 

348
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,000
with their own resources and 

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,600
he build this first classroom with them, this is the second grade 

350
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,300
and he did the best thing he'd have done 

351
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,200
he walked away, he went trekking for two weeks 

352
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,400
and he said "alright guys, it's time for you to figure this out 

353
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,100
and sure enough our local team that had never built 

354
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,200
a bamboo construction built 3 more classrooms in the span of 2 weeks 

355
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,300
this is our structure going up 

356
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,700


357
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,900
this is the first 4 classrooms 

358
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,500
nursery, the 2nd grade 

359
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,300
that's the septic tank actually 

360
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,700


361
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,500
the school has just opened this past june 

362
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
and it's a beautiful place 

363
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,400
it was made from the earth, with clay and stone 

364
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
and bamboo and a tin roof 

365
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,000
and the children, all 200 of them 

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,800
will be again the first literate children of their families 

367
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
they get health care 

368
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,600
basic medical treatment 

369
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,100
a meal every day 

370
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,000
which is usually the only meal they'll receive 

371
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,800
here's the aerial view from the house 

372
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,100
the land that I ended up finding was just a stone throw away 

373
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,000
after searching for six months and having deal after deal fall through 

374
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
was not easy 

375
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,100
this was a year of the hardest work that I ever done 

376
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,200
and sleepless nights and everything else you can imagine 

377
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,900
but that first day at school was amazing 

378
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,400
we opened with a big puppet show 

379
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,600
and we had this stage that we made 

380
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,400
every psychologist that I've talked to 

381
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,600
has said that for children the best you can do 

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,700
is having them performing and doing arts and music and sports 

383
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,800
just getting them to express themselves as much as possible 

384
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,300
so we did a big show on stage 

385
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,800
and kids narrated everything with puppets 

386
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,500
here's the girls up on stage 

387
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,100
and our soccer team 

388
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,200


389
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,700
I didn't want this to be a sad story 

390
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,300
so Lakota, actually 

391
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,200
this is her a year ago 

392
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,400
and this is her today 

393
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,300
in her classroom 

394
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,500
and in her uniform 

395
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,200
it's what I think every girl and every child deserves 

396
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,100
is a home and a safe place to live in 

397
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,200
just their most basic, basic needs 

398
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,400
Again, 80 million children in the world today that are out of school 

399
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,900
that don't have enough food 

400
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,000
that aren't safe 

401
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,800
some won't make past the age of 5 

402
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,200
it's overwhelming and it's sad 

403
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,700
I hate to be the bearer of bad news always 

404
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
and I've to be a lot of the times 

405
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,500
but I think we can do it 

406
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,900
I think we all have the power to create something 

407
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,600
and I don't think you've to go 8,000 miles away 

408
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,700
to the foothills of Himalayas 

409
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,400
I think the beauty of all of us is that we have talents, we have gifts 

410
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,600
and this just happen to remind me I'm really lucky to have found it 

411
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,700
and create my little slice of Heaven 

412
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,400
my little paradise 

413
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,900
and I think that the world'll change when we all found it for ourselves 

414
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,300
where we wake up everyday 

415
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,200
and we wouldn't rather be anywhere else in the world 

416
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,100
doing any other kind of work 

417
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,700
and it just so happens it would be great if that work, really, everybody will profited 

418
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,400
and only good can come out of it 

419
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,300
so that's Kopila Valley to me 

420
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,000
it's my slice of heaven 

421
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Why do I think it worked? When so many organizations, so many projects tend to fail these days 

422
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
especially with a foreign aid 

423
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,200
I think being young really helped 

424
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,900
I'm standing up here at 23 years old not the oldest or the wisest person here 

425
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,200
but being young was my greatest strength I think 

426
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,100
that attitude that some people call you naive 

427
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,900
you know, you think that you're unstoppable 

428
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,000
but really if we all had that attitude 

429
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,100
that we can do anything, we can be anything 

430
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,900
if we follow our dreams in our hearts 

431
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,800
and I even see myself sort of losing it as I get older 

432
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,100
we start to get more doubtful 

433
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,700
we think of all the things we don't have instead of the things we do have 

434
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,900
"oh I could do that if I had more money, 

435
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,200
I could do that if I had my masters degree, 

436
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,500
once I've my PhD, 

437
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,300
after I'm settled, after I'm established, after I'm famous 

438
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,500
what if every thing you had is everything you've right now 

439
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,100
your body and your mind 

440
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,200
and that sense of "I can do anything" 

441
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,000
I watched my children the other day 

442
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,800
I just took this picture 

443
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,900
and they were trying to take a kite up in the air 

444
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,700
and they were entertaining themselves for 2 hours 

445
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
just trying to get this kite up 

446
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,800
and I was watching them and I was like 

447
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,900
"you guys, you're not being able to do it without the wind" 

448
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,300
and they just kept trying and trying and trying for hours and hours 

449
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,300
and sure enough, just after I came up on the roof 

450
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,200
I said "guys you need the wind" 

451
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,600
and a huge gust of wind swept trough and the kite went up in the air 

452
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,000
and they all just cheered 

453
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,400
and I thought of that childlike feeling of 

454
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,400
keep going, keep trying and you won't fail 

455
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,400
I thought that was a really powerful message for myself 

456
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,800
that if we can all go back to that childlike state of 

457
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,200
just keep going and have fun with it 

458
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,700
it'll be a really beautiful place 

459
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,400
so my big do 

460
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,200
David yesterday said we've to dream big 

461
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,700
so there's 80 million children in the world right now 

462
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,300
and in my lifetime 

463
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,300
who are orphaned and don't have enough food to eat and are out of primary school 

464
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:50,100
in my lifetime I'd like to see all of them have their basic, most basic human needs met 

465
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,100
luckily I'm only 23, so we've a lot of time to do that 

466
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,400
and I think that we can 

467
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,100
and my little do 

468
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,400
I guess would be my 30 children at home waiting for me 

469
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,300
a lot of them are under the age of 5 and they need a lot of focus and attention right now 

470
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,400
so that's where I'm headed 

471
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,300
thank you all very much
